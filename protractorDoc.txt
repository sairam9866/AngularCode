1.Multimple Browesers Protractor Test Cases Execution.
Using multiCapabilities will run all the tests in each of the browsers. So the configuration below will run every test twice, once in Firefox and once in Chrome:

multiCapabilities: [{
  'browserName': 'chrome'
}, {
  'browserName': 'firefox'
}],
If you would rather have each test file just run once, but split up among multiple browsers, then use the splitTestsBetweenCapabilities option:

splitTestsBetweenCapabilities: true
